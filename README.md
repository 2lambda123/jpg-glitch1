image triangulation experiment
===

this is an experiment for the web browser. it uses the [delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) algorithm to alter an image.

[online demo](http://snorpey.github.io/triangulation/)

this experiment is very much based on the [triangulation image generator](http://jsdo.it/akm2/xoYx) script. it includes several speed enhancements. it is my goal to make it fast enough for use with real time streaming input, e.g. from a [web cam](https://github.com/snorpey/photobooth).

you can fine another experiment that applies the the triangulation to text input here: [http://snorpey.github.io/text-triangulation/](http://snorpey.github.io/text-triangulation/)
